	<h1> Hello World </h1>
	
	<p> Welcome to my portfolio. Obviously it's still a work in progress, but by the time that I'm done, you'll be able ot see my projects that I completed in my time as SLCC as well as personal projects I do in my own time. 
	</p>
	<br>
	<p> I'm happy you were able to stop by.
